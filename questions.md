# Questions

## How did you approach solving the problem?

Used Agile delivery approach. 
First i started with understanding the requirements. then planned the task based on the goal to complete the mandatory task. once completing the MVP version of the task, i started building optional tasks.

## How did you verify your solution works correctly?
for validating the happy path, i used unit test case. For all other negative scenario, i did testing manually. for some verification, i used some of tips like tampering the Wi-Fi.

## How long did you spend on the exercise?
I spent around 3 hrs on completing the exercise.
  1. 20 mins for analysing and planning.
  2. 2 hours for build and validating my code end to end.
  2. 15 mins for testing negative scenarios, including testing resume download scenario also for I had to test that code multiple times because I wanted to include resume and wanted the remaining time estimations to be accurate.
  3. 10 mins to code clean up and beautification.
  4. And 15 mins for writing code for checking the file integrity.

## What would you add if you had more time and how?
I would have added more unit test scenarios; Currently I have just written a happy path.
I would have added more exception handling to the project and would have logged the error to a file. 
Also, I would have moved some of the configurable variables to a config file, variable like batch size, file name. Would have added more null checks and other coding standards.
